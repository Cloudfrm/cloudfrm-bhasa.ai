"""Courtesy and gesture words, answered like a person would.

Twenty common courtesies all fell through to retrieval and came back as
"I understood: 'X'. I can walk through login, transfers…". Two were worse:
"ok" returned OTP validity rules and "yes" returned a loan interest rate —
and the fallback the member was answering had just said "or say yes and I
will open a ticket".

Matching runs on the member's original text, before transliteration, and only
when the courtesy is essentially the whole message. "Hello, when is my loan
due?" is a loan question with a greeting attached, and must stay one.
